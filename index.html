            <p>My husband and I camped overnight &amp; did the short loop around these beautiful sandstone rock
               formations.
               All went well until we came back to an almost flat tire. Hard to avoid that one and thankfully we were
               able
               to get home safely. 10/10 would do again.</p>

               <h2>Mount Sherman, Colorado</h2>
               <h3>August 2018</h3>
            </div>
            <p>While spending a summer out in Colorado, my husband came to visit. I had done a few
               other
               14ers at that point and wanted to try a relatively short one with him. We decided to approach Mt. Sherman from its western trailhead. We arrived to a crowded trailhead
               with
               cars parked all along the forest road. We started hiking from the road, and the trail was well marked up
               to
               an old mining shack. However, past this mining shack the trail turned into a very steep uphill path of
               scree. My husband wanted to turn back since his shoes didn't have great grip. I tried to reassure him
               that
               the trail would probably get better past the next hill top of scree. Good thing he didn't listen to me!
               As
               we were discussing, a pair of hikers descended towards us with helmets on and mountaineering gear. Turns
               out
               we were on the wrong trail. By the time we turned around and were back at the forest and some of the cars
               had left, we saw where we missed the correct trailhead. Unfortunately we did not have enough time to try
               again that day. I was able to complete the trail with friends later that month from the eastern
               trailhead
               and laughed when I was on the summit looking down to the west and saw how difficult our
               "trail" would have been to get to the summit. Whoops! </p>

               <h3>March 2017</h3>
            </div>
            <p>On my way from New Orleans to Houston to visit friends, I needed a place to stay overnight. Since I was
               in
               grad school at the time and traveling alone, the cheaper the better. I found a state park with
               backcountry
               campsites a couple of miles from the parking lot by a beautiful lake. Seemed easy enough for a
               quick overnight camp. I arrived late in the day and hiked through the forest along lakeshore to a very
               small peninsula where I set up my tent. The park was silent and eerily beautiful with its black
               water, big cypress trees, and spanish moss...that is until I saw a gator about 10 feet away
               in
               the water. At this point it was dusk, so I didn't want to risk walking back as the sky
               was
               getting dark. I watched the gator, and it eventually went on its way. Needless to say I didn't get much
               sleep that night. But, still worth it to see the beautiful sunrise over the lake.</p>

               <h2>North Cascades National Park, Washington</h2>
               <h3>July 2016</h3>
            </div>
            <p>On another road trip from visiting friends in Vancouver, BC back to my then home in Portland, OR, I
               decided
               to take a detour to visit North Cascades National Park. I had wanted to see the beautiful park for some
               time
               and knew this would be my last chance for a while since I was moving to St. Louis later that month.
               Knowing
               that the hikes might not be very accessible yet due to snow still present in July, I was able to find one
               trailhead that was snow free. I alloted myself a few hours of hiking before I needed to start driving the
               6
               hours back to Portland. I hiked for about an hour and a half admiring the stunning snow capped mountain
               peaks before turning back. Shortly into the second half of my hike I slipped coming off a wet patch of
               scree
               and fell twisting my ankle. Thankfully I was able to hobble back to the car and drive back safely.
               However,
               by the time I reached Portland, my ankle had swelled up to the size of a golf ball. But, would I do it
               again? Yes, 100% for those views.</p>

               <h2>Three Fingered Jack, Oregon</h2>
               <h3>August 2014</h3>
            </div>
            <p>One of my last hikes I completed while living in Central Oregon was Canyon Creek Meadows in the Mount
               Jefferson Wilderness. A relatively short, easy, and popular day hike, I felt confident doing the loop
               trail
               alone. However, as I was heading back and walking through an area of burned forest, I realized
               there
               were multiple trails forking from where I had stopped to pick some blueberries. I thought I was on the
               right trail
               and followed that for a mile until it came to a lake. I quickly realized there had been no lake mentioned in the trail description I
               had
               read before starting the hike. The shadows were getting longer and the burned forest was
               disorienting,
               but thankfully I ran/walked back to the junction and was able to find my way safely back to the trailhead
               before dark. Despite the temporary confusion, all in all a beautiful hike.</p>
